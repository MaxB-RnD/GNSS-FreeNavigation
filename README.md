# GNSS-FreeNav  

GNSS-FreeNav is a deep learning-based navigation system designed for **GNSS-denied environments**, leveraging **IMU, LiDAR, and Camera data** to estimate precise vehicle positioning. This project aims to enhance autonomous navigation capabilities in high-risk or GPS-denied areas, such as defense applications and remote environments.  


## Features  
- **Deep Learning-Based Localisation** – Uses AI models & Machine Learning Techniques to predict GNSS coordinates from onboard sensor data.  
- **Sensor Fusion** – Integrates IMU, LiDAR, and Camera inputs for improved accuracy.  
- **Robust to GNSS Outages** – Provides navigation solutions when GPS signals are unavailable.  
- **Optimised for Embedded Systems** – Designed for deployment on platforms like the Jetson Nano.  
- **Incorporates Open-Source Models** – Builds upon existing research, including LVI-SAM.

## Branch Guide
### LVI-SAM  
This branch contains an **updated and working version** of the base model selected for performance metrics as part of this project. The README in this branch provides **setup instructions** for the required libraries and dependencies to run the project on AICRAFT systems, based on the best-known configuration at the time of creation.
