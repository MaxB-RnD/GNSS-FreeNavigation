# GNSS-FreeNav
GNSS-FreeNav is a deep learning-based navigation system designed for **GNSS-denied environments**, leveraging **IMU, LiDAR, and Camera data** to estimate precise vehicle positioning. This project aims to enhance autonomous navigation capabilities in high-risk or GPS-denied areas, such as defense applications and remote environments.</br></br>

## Branch Guide
### LVI-SAM  
This branch contains an **updated and working version** of the base model selected for performance metrics as part of this project. The README in this branch provides **setup instructions** for the required libraries and dependencies to run the project on AICRAFT systems, based on the best-known configuration at the time of creation.
