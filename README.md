# GNSS-FreeNav
GNSS-FreeNav is a deep learning-based navigation system designed for GNSS-denied environments, leveraging IMU, LiDAR, and Camera data to estimate precise vehicle positioning. This project aims to enhance autonomous navigation capabilities in high-risk or GPS-denied areas, such as defense applications and remote environments.
